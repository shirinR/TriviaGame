<!--
1- You'll create a trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.
2- If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option.
After a few seconds, display the next question -- do this without user input.
3- The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.
4- If the player runs out of time, tell the player that time's up and display the correct answer.
Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
5- If the player chooses the wrong answer, tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display
the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
6- On the final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart
the game (without reloading the page). -->
